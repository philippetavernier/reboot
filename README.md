##Summary


##jQuery UI support

This theme targets jQuery UI 1.9.2 and the default version of jQuery included in the (current) jQuery UI builds (jQuery 1.6.2).
I'm aware of jQuery 1.8.2 and intend on upgrading anything necessary in the theme to use it when the jQuery UI team officially include it in their theme packs.

##Project status

This project is under active, but slow development. There has been a great deal
of work done in branches to introduce compatibility with jQuery UI 1.9 and further
